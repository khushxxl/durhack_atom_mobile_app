          tone_analysis:
            "Throughout the conversation, the tone exhibited a complex interplay of emotions and professional conduct. The customer's tone initially reflected anxiety and uncertainty, evidenced by their use of phrases expressing unease and overwhelm regarding their real estate investment. Their vocal patterns showed signs of stress when discussing market fluctuations and portfolio concentration. However, as the conversation progressed, their tone gradually shifted towards cautious optimism, particularly when receiving reassurance and structured guidance from the adviser. The adviser maintained a consistently calm, empathetic, and professional tone throughout the interaction. Their voice carried authority without being domineering, effectively balancing emotional support with practical guidance. The adviser's tone was particularly effective in moments of validation, using phrases like 'completely normal' and 'valid concern' to create a safe space for discussion. The overall tone evolved from one of anxiety to collaborative problem-solving, with both parties engaging in constructive dialogue. The adviser's measured responses and the customer's gradual relaxation in tone created a harmonious dynamic that facilitated productive discussion of complex financial decisions.",
